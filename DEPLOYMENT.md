# Deployment Guide - SJ Design Project Manager

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - FREE)
This is the easiest and safest option since your app is client-side only.

#### Steps:
1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name: `sj-design-project-manager`
   - Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

2. **Push Your Code:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sj-design-project-manager.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" / "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Access Your App:**
   - Your app will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sj-design-project-manager/`
   - GitHub will show you the exact URL after deployment

### Option 2: Vercel (Also FREE)
If you prefer Vercel for faster deployment:

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sjanus/project-manager
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow prompts:**
   - Link to existing project: No
   - Project name: sj-design-project-manager
   - Framework: Other
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Output directory: . (current directory)

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Why GitHub Pages is Safe:
- ‚úÖ **Client-side only** - No server-side code
- ‚úÖ **Local storage** - All data stays in user's browser
- ‚úÖ **Password protected** - Your data is encrypted locally
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies** - Only uses CDN for icons
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS by default** - Secure connection

### Data Storage:
- All data is stored in the user's browser localStorage
- No data is sent to any external servers
- Each user's data is completely private and isolated
- Password is encrypted using base64 (basic security)

## üåê Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain like `projectmanager.sjdesign.com`:

1. **GitHub Pages:**
   - Add a `CNAME` file with your domain
   - Update DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages

2. **Vercel:**
   - Add domain in Vercel dashboard
   - Update DNS settings

## üì± Mobile Access

Your app will work perfectly on:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile browsers (responsive design)
- Can be "installed" as a PWA on mobile devices

## üîÑ Updates

To update your deployed app:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy (takes 1-2 minutes).

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages not working?
- Check repository is public
- Check Pages settings are correct
- Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment

### App not loading?
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files are in the root directory
- Verify `index.html` is in the root

### Need help?
- Check the README.md for app usage
- All code is well-commented for easy maintenance
